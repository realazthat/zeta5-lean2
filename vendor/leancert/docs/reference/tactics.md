# Tactics Reference

Canonical syntax reference for LeanCert tactics. Start with [`leancert`](#leancert-and-leancert);
the dedicated tactics below are advanced controls for selecting a particular
proof strategy.

## Syntax Index

| Tactic | Accepted invocation forms |
|---|---|
| `leancert`, `leancert?` | `leancert ((budget \| taylorDepth \| subdivisions \| maxIterations) := n)* (trust := native\|kernel\|auto)?` |
| `interval_decide`, `interval_auto`, `certify_bound` | optional positional Taylor depth, followed by optional `(trust := native\|kernel\|auto)` |
| `interval_refute` | optional positional depth |
| `interval_bound_subdiv` | optional positional Taylor depth and subdivision depth, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `multivariate_bound` | optional positional iteration count, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `opt_bound` | optional positional iteration count, followed by optional `mono` and `(trust := ...)` |
| `root_bound`, `interval_roots`, `interval_unique_root` | optional positional Taylor depth, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `system_unique_root`, `system_unique_root?` | optional `using cert`; automatic mode also accepts `(maxIterations := n)` and `(maxDimension := n)`, plus `(taylorDepth := n)` and `(trust := native\|kernel\|auto)` |
| `interval_minimize`, `interval_maximize` | optional positional Taylor depth, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `interval_minimize_mv`, `interval_maximize_mv` | optional positional Taylor depth, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `interval_argmin`, `interval_argmax` | optional positional Taylor depth, followed by optional `(trust := ...)` |
| `discover` | optional positional Taylor depth |
| `finsum_bound` | optional `using evaluator proof`, then optional precision; or `auto evaluator`, then optional precision; all forms accept a trailing `(trust := ...)` |
| `finsum_witness` | `finsum_witness evaluator using proof`, then optional precision |
| `interval_bound_adaptive` | optional positional maximum-iteration count |
| `integral_exact`, `interval_norm`, `finsum_expand`, `vec_simp` | no positional arguments |

The interval, bound, root, optimization, extrema, and `finsum_bound` certificate
tactics in the index accept a trailing inline `(trust := ...)`. `discover` and
`finsum_witness` honor the scoped `leancert.trust` option. Exact kernel proof
construction such as `integral_exact` does not consult the trust option. Trust
selects certificate verification; it does not select a Rational, Dyadic, or
Affine numerical backend.

## Trust Modes

LeanCert proof-producing certificate tactics close their Boolean certificates
through a single verification choke point with an explicit trust choice.
Diagnostic and simplification tactics do not necessarily produce a Boolean
certificate:

```lean
example : Real.log 2 < 7/10 := by interval_decide (trust := kernel)
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ 3 := by
  certify_bound (trust := auto)

set_option leancert.trust "kernel" in   -- or file/project-wide
theorem log2 : Real.log 2 < 7/10 := by interval_decide

#print axioms log2
-- [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]  ← no compiler trust
```

| Mode | Certificate closed by | Trusted base | Behavior on failure |
|------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| `native` (default) | `native_decide` | kernel + compiler (`Lean.ofReduceBool`) | error |
| `kernel` | `decide +kernel` | kernel only | hard error — **never** falls back to native |
| `auto` | kernel, then native | kernel where it succeeds | fallback reported once per process; details under `trace[leancert.verification]` |

Per-invocation `(trust := …)` overrides `set_option leancert.trust`, which
overrides the native default. The syntax index above identifies tactics with
an inline override. `discover` and `finsum_witness` use the scoped option.

The verification boundary distinguishes a checker that evaluates to `false`
from an inability to run the checker. The former is ordinary certificate
rejection and may allow another solver strategy to run; kernel reduction,
native compilation, evaluation, or protocol failures are terminal. Automatic
mode falls back from an unfinished kernel attempt, never from a conclusive
`false` result.

Guidance from the calibration data (`scripts/bench-trust/README.md`): kernel
verification is essentially free for point inequalities and quantified
bounds, cheap for moderate partition/subdivision counts, and crosses over
around 10⁴ finite-sum terms. `auto` encodes exactly this policy — its cost
gates are tunable via the `leancert.trust.auto*` options. Pin the result in
CI with `#assert_trust kernel thm` / `#assert_trust native thm`.

## Semantic Front Door

### `leancert` and `leancert?`

`leancert` classifies the mathematical shape of a goal and tries a bounded
portfolio through isolated, validated proof artifacts. Failed attempts restore
the complete tactic state; successful native computations retain generated
declarations required by their checked proof artifacts while restoring the
caller's goal list. `leancert?` also reports the winning strategy and its
dedicated advanced control when one exists. Closed Boolean checkers whose implementation is under the
`LeanCert` namespace are routed to `native_decide`; arbitrary closed
propositions are not.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x^2 ≤ 1 := by leancert
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x^2 ≤ x + 1 := by leancert
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2, x^2 = 2 := by leancert?
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, x^2) = 1/3 := by leancert
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, Real.exp x) ≤ 2 := by leancert
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x * (1 - x) ≤ (27/100 : ℚ) := by
  leancert (subdivisions := 8)
```

The semantic parser accepts interval membership and root/optimizer predicates
in either conjunction order. Comparisons whose two operands both depend on the
quantified variables are normalized to a difference bound and transported back
to the theorem stated by the user. Numerical interval certificates currently
operate over `ℝ`; another carrier is reported as an unsupported domain rather
than an internal verifier failure.

Imported unary enclosure rules registered through
`LeanCert.Tactic.Extension` participate in univariate interval bounds. The
router certifies each registered application, verifies its downstream Boolean
checker under the requested trust policy, and applies the registered soundness
theorem. Checked results become proof-carrying atoms for the ordinary core
evaluator, allowing supported operations around them. `leancert?` reports every
retained downstream checker and theorem together with any surrounding
composition. Rejected or comparison-inconclusive registered candidates are
retried by rational bisection up to `(subdivisions := n)`; domain obstructions
remain terminal. See [Downstream enclosure extensions](extensions.md).

For a narrow import and deterministic execution of exactly that strategy, use:

```text
import LeanCert.Tactic.Extension
import LeanCert.Tactic.Enclosure

example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, downstreamFunction x ≤ 2 := by
  enclosure_bound (taylorDepth := 10) (subdivisions := 4) (trust := auto)
```

`enclosure_bound?` proves the same goal and reports certificate count, checked
composition, subdivision statistics, and the observed verification route. Both
forms are transactional on rejection, exhaustion, domain obstruction, and
verification failure. The focused module does not import discovery, finite-sum,
Krawczyk, or semantic-router tactics.

Expected checker rejection, unsupported expressions, inconclusive enclosures,
and certified counterexamples are rendered as separate diagnostic categories.
Raw checker propositions are available only through
`set_option trace.LeanCert.solver true`.

Inline options are `budget`, `taylorDepth`, `subdivisions`, and
`maxIterations`. The budget limits cumulative deterministic strategy cost; exact
normalization is free. It does not alter
Lean's heartbeat setting. Integral equalities over the rational-polynomial
fragment use the executable `QPoly.checkExactIntegral` checker. Integral
inequalities fall back to checked rational partition search. State ordinary
integral equalities or inequalities and use `leancert`.

Conjunctions of recognized numerical goals are routed recursively, including
goals exposed by `forall_and`. Every child must be independently supported and
proved. Disjunctions are intentionally not routed: choosing a logical branch
is not a numerical-certification decision.

`integral_exact` is the dedicated exact-polynomial tactic reported by
`leancert?`; it supports rational constants, `+`, `-`, `*`, natural powers,
and division by a nonzero rational constant.

## Bound Proving

### `certify_bound`

Proves universal bounds over intervals using a Dyadic-first interval portfolio
with Rational fallback. The verification route is independent of whichever
numerical backend succeeds.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.IntervalAuto

-- Basic usage
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ 3 := by certify_bound

-- With Taylor depth (higher = tighter bounds, slower)
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ 2.72 := by certify_bound 15

-- Lower bounds
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, 0 ≤ Real.exp x := by certify_bound

-- Strict inequalities
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x < 3 := by certify_bound
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `depth` | `ℕ` | 10 | Taylor series depth for transcendentals |

**Supported functions:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (rational exponents), `abs`, `max`, `min`, `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `sqrt`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `atan`, `arsinh`, `atanh`, `sinc`, `erf`, `log`, `inv`

**Note on rational exponents:** general rational exponents like `x^(1/3)` are lowered to `exp(log(x) * q)`, which requires the base to be provably positive from interval bounds.

---

### Verification routes

`certify_bound`, `interval_decide`, `interval_auto`, and `leancert` accept an
independent certificate-verification route. Kernel mode uses `decide +kernel`
and never silently falls back.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

-- Kernel-only certificate verification.
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ 3 := by
  certify_bound (trust := kernel)

-- Kernel first, with a reported native fallback when appropriate.
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ 3 := by
  certify_bound (trust := auto)
```

**Trust levels:**

| Mode | Verification | Trusted Components |
|---|---|---|
| `kernel` | `decide +kernel` | Lean kernel only |
| `native` (default) | `native_decide` | Lean kernel + compiler/runtime |
| `auto` | Kernel first, with calibrated gates and reported fallback | Depends on the route used |

**Diagnostics:** Enable `set_option trace.leancert.verification true` to see
the selected verification route.

---

### `interval_decide`

Proves point inequalities involving specific numbers (transcendentals like π, e).

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.IntervalAuto

example : Real.pi < 3.15 := by interval_decide
example : Real.exp 1 < 3 := by interval_decide
example : Real.sin 1 + Real.cos 1 < 1.5 := by interval_decide
example : Real.sqrt 2 < 1.42 := by interval_decide
```

Use this for concrete values. For universally quantified mathematical bounds,
start with `leancert`; use `certify_bound` for explicit interval-engine control.

---

### `interval_auto`

Combines normalization and interval automation for point or interval goals. It
accepts the same optional Taylor depth and inline trust item as
`interval_decide` and `certify_bound`.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : Real.exp 1 < 3 := by
  interval_auto 10 (trust := kernel)
```

### `interval_norm`

Normalizes supported interval expressions without selecting a semantic-router
portfolio. It takes no arguments and is primarily a low-level building block.

---

## Counter-Example Search

### `interval_refute`

Searches for counter-examples to disprove false bounds.

The following is a compiled expected-failure test: the bound is false because
`x²` reaches `4` on `[-2, 2]`.

```lean expect-error: Counter-example FOUND
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (-2 : ℝ) 2, x * x ≤ 3 := by
  interval_refute
```

This is an expected-failure example: the tactic reports a checked violating
point and intentionally leaves the false theorem unproved.

**Output types:**

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Verified` | Rigorous proof that bound fails at this point |
| `Candidate` | Likely counter-example (may be precision artifact) |

**Configuration:**

```text
-- In a development scratch theorem:
-- interval_refute (config := { maxIterations := 100,
--                              tolerance := 1 / 1000000 })
```
---

## Discovery Tactics

### `interval_minimize` / `interval_maximize`

Proves existence of global minimum/maximum via branch-and-bound optimization.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

-- Find and prove a lower bound exists
example : ∃ m, ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 2, x * x - x ≥ m := by
  interval_minimize

-- With Taylor depth
example : ∃ m, ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.sin x ≥ m := by
  interval_minimize 15
```

---

### `interval_roots`

Proves root existence via sign change detection (Intermediate Value Theorem).

**Native syntax (recommended):**

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

-- Prove √2 exists in [1, 2]
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2, x^2 - 2 = 0 := by
  interval_roots

-- Also supports f(x) = c form
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2, x^2 = 2 := by
  interval_roots

-- Transcendental roots
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2, Real.cos x = 0 := by
  interval_roots
```

**Expr AST syntax (also supported):**

```lean
open LeanCert.Core

def I12 : IntervalRat := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num⟩

example : ∃ x ∈ I12, Expr.eval (fun _ => x)
    (Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))) = 0 := by
  interval_roots
```

**How it works:**
1. Evaluates expression at interval endpoints
2. Detects sign change (f(lo) < 0 < f(hi) or vice versa)
3. Applies IVT to prove existence

`intervalRootsCoreTyped` returns the retained checker and verifier identities,
verification usage, and Taylor depth. A false sign-change check is typed
rejection and restores the original tactic state.

---

### `interval_unique_root`

Proves root uniqueness via Newton contraction mapping.

**Native syntax (recommended):**

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

-- Prove there's exactly one root of x² - 2 in [1, 2]
example : ∃! x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2, x^2 - 2 = 0 := by
  interval_unique_root
```

**Expr AST syntax (also supported):**

```lean
open LeanCert.Core

def I12 : IntervalRat := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num⟩
def expr_x2_minus_2 : Expr := Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))

example : ∃! x ∈ I12, Expr.eval (fun _ => x) expr_x2_minus_2 = 0 := by
  unfold expr_x2_minus_2
  interval_unique_root
```

**How it works:**
1. Computes Newton operator N(x) = x - f(x)/f'(x)
2. Verifies N maps interval into itself
3. Verifies |N'(x)| < 1 (contraction)
4. Banach fixed-point theorem gives uniqueness

`intervalUniqueRootCoreTyped` distinguishes unsupported goals, rejected
Newton certificates, proof transport failures, and internal verification
failures. Every failure is transactional.

---

### `system_unique_root` and `system_unique_root?`

Certifies a unique zero of a square nonlinear system. Automatic mode generates
a rational `KrawczykCert n`; manual mode accepts a user-supplied certificate:

```lean
import LeanCert.Examples.Krawczyk
import LeanCert.Tactic

open LeanCert.Core LeanCert.Engine LeanCert.Validity
open LeanCert.Examples.Krawczyk

example : ∃! x, FinBoxMem x box ∧ SystemZero system x := by
  system_unique_root (maxIterations := 8) (taylorDepth := 10) (trust := auto)
```

The tactic accepts the conjunction in either order. `system_unique_root?`
proves the same goal and reports attempts, Newton refinements, generated center
and preconditioner, checked contraction bound, `krawczykCheck`,
`verify_unique_system_root`, and the observed verification route. Candidate
generation is untrusted and the selected candidate is replayed through the I1
checker. Candidate rejection, singular midpoint Jacobians, budget exhaustion,
unsupported AD, and dimension limits are typed, transactional failures.

Use `system_unique_root using certificate` to bypass search while retaining the
same trusted verification boundary. Automatic box subdivision is intentionally
excluded because a certificate on one sub-box does not prove uniqueness over
the original target box.

---

### Integral goals

State ordinary equalities and inequalities and use `leancert`:

```lean
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, x ^ 2) = 1 / 3 := by leancert
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, Real.sin x) ≤ 1 := by leancert
```

Use `integral_exact` as an advanced control when the integrand is in the
rational-polynomial fragment:

```lean
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, x ^ 2) = 1 / 3 := by
  integral_exact
```

**How it works:**

1. Reifies the supported rational polynomial.
2. Checks its exact rational antiderivative value with
   `QPoly.checkExactIntegral`.
3. Applies `QPoly.integral_eq_of_check` to the ordinary integral goal.

Nonpolynomial integral inequalities use the separate checked partition-search
strategy selected by `leancert`.

## Interactive Commands

These commands are for **exploration in the editor**, not for proofs. Use them to discover bounds before writing theorems.

### `#bounds`

Find both minimum and maximum of a function on an interval.

```lean
import LeanCert.Discovery.Commands

#bounds (fun x => x^2 + Real.sin x) on [-2, 2]
```

**Output:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
#bounds Results
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  f(x) ∈ [-5, 5]

  Minimum: -5 (± 4.77)
  Maximum: 5 (± 0.91)

  Total iterations: 32
  Verified: ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

### `#find_min` / `#find_max`

Find the minimum or maximum separately, with optional precision control.

```lean
import LeanCert.Discovery.Commands

-- Basic usage
#find_min (fun x => x^2 + Real.sin x) on [-2, 2]
#find_max (fun x => Real.exp x - x^2) on [0, 1]

-- Higher precision for tighter bounds
#find_max (fun x => Real.exp x) on [0, 1] precision 20
```

**Syntax:**
```
#find_min <function> on [<lo>, <hi>]
#find_min <function> on [<lo>, <hi>] precision <n>
```

**Parameters:**
- `function`: A lambda `(fun x => ...)` with the expression
- `lo`, `hi`: Integer bounds (rationals not supported in syntax)
- `precision`: Optional Taylor depth (default: 10)

---

### `#explore`

Interactive function analysis in the editor. Shows range, extrema, and roots.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

open LeanCert LeanCert.Core

-- Explore sin(x) on [0, 4]
#explore (Expr.sin (Expr.var 0)) on [0, 4]
```

**Output includes:**
- Domain and computed range
- Global minimum and maximum with locations
- Sign changes (potential roots)
- Monotonicity information

---

## Additional Tactics

### `discover`

Meta-tactic that analyzes the goal and automatically routes to `interval_minimize` or `interval_maximize`.

```lean
def discoveryInterval : IntervalRat := ⟨-1, 1, by norm_num⟩

def squareExpr : Expr := Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)

example : ∃ m : ℚ, ∀ x ∈ discoveryInterval,
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) squareExpr ≥ m := by
  discover

example : ∃ M : ℚ, ∀ x ∈ discoveryInterval,
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) squareExpr ≤ M := by
  discover
```

---

### `interval_minimize_mv` / `interval_maximize_mv`

Multivariate versions of minimize/maximize for N-dimensional domains.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

-- Find minimum over 2D domain
example : ∃ m : ℚ, ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1,
    x*x + y*y ≥ m := by
  interval_minimize_mv

-- Find maximum over 2D domain
example : ∃ M : ℚ, ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1,
    x + y ≤ M := by
  interval_maximize_mv
```

Uses more samples (300) and iterations (2000) than univariate versions.
Both tactics expose typed discovery results to `leancert`: reports retain the
actual search termination, gap, checker, Golden Theorem, and verification
route. A loose search remains a valid success only when the selected endpoint
is independently certified.

---

### `multivariate_bound`

Proves bounds over multi-variable domains directly.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.IntervalAuto

-- Prove x + y ≤ 2 on [0,1] × [0,1]
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1,
    x + y ≤ (2 : ℚ) := by
  multivariate_bound
```

---

### `opt_bound`

Proves lower or upper bounds for explicit `Expr`/`Box` goals using checked
global optimization. Its accepted forms are:

```text
opt_bound
opt_bound <maxIterations>
opt_bound <maxIterations> mono
opt_bound <maxIterations> mono (trust := kernel)
```

`mono` enables monotonicity pruning. A trailing trust item is optional. This is
a strategy choice, not a
numerical-backend or trust selection.

Reported execution includes the exact checker, Golden Theorem, verification
route, configured iteration limit, and tolerance. The Boolean certificate API
does not expose actual iteration counts, so reports do not infer them.

---

### `root_bound`

Proves absence of roots by showing a function is strictly positive or negative.

**Native syntax (recommended):**

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.IntervalAuto

-- x² + 1 ≠ 0 on [0, 1] (always positive)
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x * x + 1 ≠ 0 := by
  root_bound

-- exp(x) ≠ 0 on [0, 1]
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≠ 0 := by
  root_bound 15
```

**Expr AST syntax (also supported):**

```lean
open LeanCert.Core

def I01 : IntervalRat := ⟨0, 1, by norm_num⟩

example : ∀ x ∈ I01, Expr.eval (fun _ => x)
    (Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.const 1)) ≠ (0 : ℝ) := by
  root_bound
```

`rootBoundCoreTyped` reports the exact `checkNoRoot`/`verify_no_root`
certificate pair. A zero-exclusion checker returning false is a resumable
rejection rather than an infrastructure exception, and the original goal is
restored.

---

### `interval_bound_subdiv`

Proves bounds using progressive subdivision when direct interval evaluation is too loose.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.IntervalAuto

-- Tighter bound requiring subdivision
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1, Real.exp x ≤ (272/100 : ℚ) := by
  interval_bound_subdiv 15 3 (trust := kernel)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `depth` | `ℕ` | 10 | Taylor series depth |
| `subdivDepth` | `ℕ` | 3 | Number of subdivision levels |

A trailing `(trust := native|kernel|auto)` is optional.

The implementation separates untrusted search from proof validation. Each box
is evaluated once for subdivision decisions, and each retained leaf closes one
fixed Boolean certificate through the configured verification route. The typed
core reports maximum/deepest depth, boxes examined, certified leaves, the exact
checker and Golden Theorem, and aggregate verification usage. Exhaustion,
certificate rejection, domain obstruction, proof transport failure, and
unexpected internal failure are distinct outcomes; every failure restores the
complete caller tactic state.

---

### `interval_bound_adaptive`

Runs the original branch-and-bound bound prover with an optional maximum
iteration count:

```text
interval_bound_adaptive
interval_bound_adaptive <maxIterations>
```

It honors the scoped `leancert.trust` option and does not accept an inline
trust item. Prefer `leancert` for automatic routing or `opt_bound` when working
directly with explicit `Expr`/`Box` optimization goals.

---

### `interval_argmax` / `interval_argmin`

Find the point where a function achieves its maximum/minimum.

**`interval_argmax` - Native syntax (recommended):**

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

-- Find the maximizer of x² on [-1,1] (argmax at endpoints x = ±1)
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1,
    y * y ≤ x * x := by
  interval_argmax

-- Linear function: max of 2x+1 on [0,1] (argmax at x=1)
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1,
    2 * y + 1 ≤ 2 * x + 1 := by
  interval_argmax
```

**`interval_argmin` - Native syntax (recommended):**

```lean
-- Find the minimizer of x on [0,1] (argmin at x=0)
example : ∃ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ∀ y ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1,
    x ≤ y := by
  interval_argmin
```

**Expr AST syntax (also supported):**

```lean
open LeanCert.Core

def I_neg1_1 : IntervalRat := ⟨-1, 1, by norm_num⟩
def I01 : IntervalRat := ⟨0, 1, by norm_num⟩

-- Argmax with Expr AST
example : ∃ x ∈ I_neg1_1, ∀ y ∈ I_neg1_1,
    Expr.eval (fun _ => y) (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) ≤
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) := by
  interval_argmax

-- Argmin with Expr AST
example : ∃ x ∈ I01, ∀ y ∈ I01,
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) (Expr.var 0) ≤
    Expr.eval (fun _ => y) (Expr.var 0) := by
  interval_argmin
```

**How it works:**
1. Runs branch-and-bound optimization to find candidate optimizer `xOpt`
2. Evaluates `f(xOpt)` to get a concrete bound `c`
3. For argmax: Proves `∀ y ∈ I, f(y) ≤ c` and `c ≤ f(xOpt)`, then applies transitivity
4. For argmin: Proves `∀ y ∈ I, c ≤ f(y)` and `f(xOpt) ≤ c`, then applies transitivity

**Limitations:**
- Works best when the argmax/argmin is at a rational point (e.g., interval endpoints)
- For transcendental functions, may require higher Taylor depth
- For interior optima at irrational points, consider using `interval_maximize`/`interval_minimize` instead

### Low-Level Manual Tactics

For fine-grained control, use these macros from `LeanCert.Tactic.Interval`:

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Interval

open LeanCert.Core LeanCert.Engine

def xSq : Expr := Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)
def xSq_supp : ExprSupportedCore xSq :=
  ExprSupportedCore.mul (ExprSupportedCore.var 0) (ExprSupportedCore.var 0)

def I01 : IntervalRat := ⟨0, 1, by norm_num⟩

-- Manual bounds with explicit AST and support proof
example : ∀ x ∈ I01, Expr.eval (fun _ => x) xSq ≤ (1 : ℚ) := by
  interval_le xSq, xSq_supp, I01, 1

example : ∀ x ∈ I01, (0 : ℚ) ≤ Expr.eval (fun _ => x) xSq := by
  interval_ge xSq, xSq_supp, I01, 0
```

| Macro | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `interval_le` | `∀ x ∈ I, f(x) ≤ c` |
| `interval_ge` | `∀ x ∈ I, c ≤ f(x)` |
| `interval_lt` | `∀ x ∈ I, f(x) < c` |
| `interval_gt` | `∀ x ∈ I, c < f(x)` |
| `interval_le_pt` | Pointwise `f(x) ≤ c` given `x ∈ I` |
| `interval_ge_pt` | Pointwise `c ≤ f(x)` given `x ∈ I` |

**Extended (noncomputable) versions** for expressions with `exp`:
`interval_ext_le`, `interval_ext_ge`, `interval_ext_lt`, `interval_ext_gt`

These reduce the goal to a rational inequality that must be proved manually.

## Simplification Tactics

### `vec_simp`

Simplifies vector indexing expressions with explicit `Fin.mk` constructors using a custom `dsimproc` that extracts the natural number from `Fin.mk n proof` and walks the `vecCons` chain directly.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic
import Mathlib.Tactic
import LeanCert.Tactic.VecSimp

-- Basic indexing: reduces ![a, b, c] ⟨i, proof⟩ to the i-th element
example : (![1, 2, 3] : Fin 3 → ℕ) ⟨0, by omega⟩ = 1 := by vec_simp
example : (![1, 2, 3] : Fin 3 → ℕ) ⟨1, by omega⟩ = 2 := by vec_simp
example : (![1, 2, 3] : Fin 3 → ℕ) ⟨2, by omega⟩ = 3 := by vec_simp

-- Symbolic elements
example (a b c : ℝ) : (![a, b, c] : Fin 3 → ℝ) ⟨1, by omega⟩ = b := by vec_simp

-- Longer vectors
example : (![1, 2, 3, 4, 5] : Fin 5 → ℕ) ⟨3, by omega⟩ = 4 := by vec_simp

-- In expressions (simplifies all vector indexing)
example (a b c : ℝ) : (![a, b, c] : Fin 3 → ℝ) ⟨0, by omega⟩ + 1 = a + 1 := by vec_simp

-- Combines well with ring for algebraic manipulation
example (a₀ a₁ : ℝ) :
    (![a₀, a₁] : Fin 2 → ℝ) ⟨0, by omega⟩ * (![a₀, a₁] : Fin 2 → ℝ) ⟨1, by omega⟩ +
    (![a₀, a₁] : Fin 2 → ℝ) ⟨1, by omega⟩ * (![a₀, a₁] : Fin 2 → ℝ) ⟨0, by omega⟩ = 2 * a₀ * a₁ := by
  vec_simp; ring
```

**Why this exists:** Mathlib's `cons_val` simproc uses `int?` to extract indices, which only matches numeric literals like `0`, `1`, `2`. It doesn't match explicit `Fin.mk` applications like `⟨0, by omega⟩`, which commonly appear in proofs (e.g., from `finsum_expand` or matrix indexing). The `vec_simp` dsimproc fills that gap by pattern-matching on `Fin.mk` directly.

**How it works:** A `dsimproc` (`VecSimp.vecConsFinMk`) matches applications of `vecCons` to a `Fin.mk n proof` index, extracts `n`, and recursively traverses the cons chain to return the n-th element. This is combined with standard Mathlib vector lemmas (`cons_val_zero`, `cons_val_one`, `head_cons`).

## Finite-Sum Tactics

### `finsum_bound` / `finsum_witness`

`finsum_bound` proves certified bounds for supported finite sets. It can
reify the summand automatically or use a supplied evaluator and correctness
proof:

```text
finsum_bound
finsum_bound <precision>
finsum_bound using <evaluator> <proof>
finsum_bound using <evaluator> <proof> <precision>
finsum_bound auto <evaluator>
finsum_bound auto <evaluator> <precision>
finsum_bound <precision> (trust := kernel)

finsum_witness <evaluator> using <proof>
finsum_witness <evaluator> using <proof> <precision>
```

The optional precision is measured in bits. `finsum_bound` accepts a trailing
inline trust override in every form. `finsum_witness` honors the scoped
`leancert.trust` option but does not accept an inline override.

All finite-sum forms use transactional typed cores. Reified routes evaluate a
candidate once to distinguish an invalid summand domain from an enclosure that
does not prove the requested bound, then close one retained Boolean
certificate. Witness routes retain their actual index path, term count,
enclosure, checker, verifier, and verification usage. A failed `Fin n`
rewrite or certificate attempt restores the original goal and local state.

### `finsum_expand`

Expands finite sums over Finsets into explicit additions.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic
import Mathlib.Tactic
import LeanCert.Tactic.FinSumExpand

-- Interval finsets (Icc = closed-closed)
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 3, f k = f 1 + f 2 + f 3 := by finsum_expand

-- Single element
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 5 5, f k = f 5 := by finsum_expand

-- Ico (closed-open)
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Ico 1 4, f k = f 1 + f 2 + f 3 := by finsum_expand

-- Ioc (open-closed)
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Ioc 1 3, f k = f 2 + f 3 := by finsum_expand

-- Ioo (open-open)
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Ioo 1 4, f k = f 2 + f 3 := by finsum_expand

-- Iic (unbounded below, closed) - for ℕ, means [0, n]
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Iic 2, f k = f 0 + f 1 + f 2 := by finsum_expand

-- Iio (unbounded below, open) - for ℕ, means [0, n)
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Iio 3, f k = f 0 + f 1 + f 2 := by finsum_expand

-- Empty intervals
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Ico 5 5, f k = 0 := by finsum_expand

-- Explicit finsets
example (f : ℕ → ℝ) : ∑ k ∈ ({1, 3, 7} : Finset ℕ), f k = f 1 + f 3 + f 7 := by finsum_expand

-- Combines with ring for evaluation
example : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 4, (fun n : ℕ => (n : ℝ)) k = 10 := by finsum_expand; ring

-- Power series patterns
example (a : ℕ → ℝ) (r : ℝ) : ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 3, |a n| * r ^ n =
    |a 1| * r ^ 1 + |a 2| * r ^ 2 + |a 3| * r ^ 3 := by finsum_expand
```

**Supported interval types:**

| Interval | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `Finset.Icc a b` | [a, b] closed-closed | `Icc 1 3` → {1, 2, 3} |
| `Finset.Ico a b` | [a, b) closed-open | `Ico 1 4` → {1, 2, 3} |
| `Finset.Ioc a b` | (a, b] open-closed | `Ioc 1 3` → {2, 3} |
| `Finset.Ioo a b` | (a, b) open-open | `Ioo 1 4` → {2, 3} |
| `Finset.Iic n` | [0, n] for ℕ | `Iic 2` → {0, 1, 2} |
| `Finset.Iio n` | [0, n) for ℕ | `Iio 3` → {0, 1, 2} |
| `{a, b, ...}` | Explicit set | `{1, 3, 7}` |
| `∑ i : Fin n, f i` | Fin univ | `Fin 3` → {0, 1, 2} |

**How it works:** Uses `Finset.sum_cons` and `Finset.sum_empty` rewriting combined with `native_decide` to evaluate finset membership. For `Fin n` sums, uses `Fin.sum_univ_ofNat` when `n` is a literal.

**Why this exists:** When proving bounds involving finite sums, you often need to expand them for arithmetic simplification. Without this tactic, you'd need to manually define "bridge lemmas" for each specific range.

### Shared finite-sum parser

`finsum_bound` and `finsum_witness` share a finite-set parser for their
certificate-generating paths. It recognizes `Finset.Icc`, `Finset.Ico`,
`Finset.Ioc`, `Finset.Ioo`, `Finset.range`, and explicit finite sets such as
`{1, 3, 7}` when the endpoints or elements are natural-number literals.

## Common Patterns

### Eventual bounds and cutoff discovery

`eventual_bound` certifies natural-number tails of the form
`q / (n : ℝ) ^ k ≤ c`, where `q` is nonnegative, `k` and the cutoff are
positive, and all fixed values are rational. The endpoint comparison is
checked exactly; monotonic decay of reciprocal powers proves the entire
infinite tail.

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : ∀ n : Nat, 100 ≤ n → (1 : ℝ) / n ≤ 1 / 100 := by
  eventual_bound

example : ∃ N : Nat, ∀ n ≥ N, (3 : ℝ) / n ^ 2 ≤ 3 / 100 := by
  eventual_bound using 10

example : ∃ N : Nat, ∀ n ≥ N, (3 : ℝ) / n ^ 2 ≤ 1 / 1000 := by
  eventual_bound

-- The semantic router recognizes the same existential theorem shape.
example : ∃ N : Nat, ∀ n ≥ N, (3 : ℝ) / n ^ 2 ≤ 1 / 1000 := by
  leancert
```

`eventual_bound?` proves the same goal and reports the selected tail rule and
cutoff source. For an existential goal without `using N`, LeanCert performs an
untrusted exponential search followed by bounded binary refinement. The
resulting cutoff is replayed through the exact checker before the Golden
Theorem constructs the proof. Use `(maxIterations := n)` to bound candidate
checks; if refinement exhausts the budget after finding a valid upper bracket,
LeanCert safely returns the verified upper cutoff rather than claiming
minimality.

The current certificate language remains deliberately narrow: nonnegative
rational multiples of reciprocal powers over `Nat`. General
logarithmic/exponential tails and AD-based tail rules are follow-up work.

### Proving a function is bounded

```lean
-- Upper and lower bounds with explicit interval-engine control
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, -1 ≤ Real.sin x := by
  certify_bound

example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.sin x ≤ 1 := by
  certify_bound
```

### Proving a root exists and is unique

```lean
def rootsInterval : IntervalRat := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num⟩

def rootsExpr : Expr :=
  Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))

example : ∃ x ∈ rootsInterval, Expr.eval (fun _ => x) rootsExpr = 0 := by
  unfold rootsExpr
  interval_roots

example : ∃! x, x ∈ rootsInterval ∧
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) rootsExpr = 0 := by
  unfold rootsExpr
  interval_unique_root
```

### Debugging failed proofs

```lean
set_option trace.LeanCert.router true in
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x ≤ 1 := by leancert

set_option trace.leancert.verification true in
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, x ≤ 1 := by
  certify_bound (trust := auto)
```

If a bound is too tight, increase Taylor depth, use subdivision, or run
`interval_refute` to determine whether the proposed bound is false.
### `interval_argmin` and `interval_argmax`

These tactics discover a rational candidate and certify that its value is
attained on the requested interval.  For `Expr.eval` goals the proof retains a
global-bound certificate and a point-value certificate, combined by
`LeanCert.Validity.verify_argmin` or `LeanCert.Validity.verify_argmax`.
Certificate rejection is distinct from verification infrastructure failure,
and failed proof branches do not contribute verification telemetry.

For existence-only extrema, `leancert` prefers the non-numerical compact
extreme-value theorem. Invoke these dedicated tactics when a discovered
rational witness and constituent-certificate telemetry are desired.
