# LeanCert

LeanCert is a Lean 4 library for certified numerical computation and
proof-producing certificate workflows.

For theorem proving, begin with [`leancert`](direct/leancert.md). For
programmatic use, see the [supported public API](reference/public-api.md).
For a compact evaluation path, build the [curated showcase](showcase.md) and
read the [trust model](architecture/trust-model.md).

LeanCert is organized around proof intent:

1. **Direct automation** closes concrete bounds, roots, optimizations, and
   integral goals over explicit expressions.
2. **Proof templates** package reusable certificate strategies such as table
   checking, main-term/error envelopes, perturbation observers, product-integral
   identities, and contour-shift bookkeeping.
3. **Domain libraries** provide specialized mathematics, especially analytic
   number theory and q-product certificates, built on top of the templates.
4. **Architecture and trust** explains checkers, Golden Theorems, arithmetic
   backends, and verification status.

## Quick Lean Example

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, Real.sin x ≤ 1 := by
  leancert
```

## Install

Add LeanCert as a Lake dependency:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "leancert"
git = "https://github.com/alerad/leancert"
rev = "main"
```

For reproducible proofs, pin a tested LeanCert release tag instead of `main`.
Use `main` only when intentionally following unreleased changes.

Then run:

```bash
lake update
```
