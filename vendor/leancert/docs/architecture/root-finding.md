# Root Finding Algorithms

LeanCert provides verified root finding with proofs of existence and uniqueness.

## Overview

| Algorithm | Proves | Method | Tactic |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Bisection | Existence | Sign change + IVT | `interval_roots` |
| Newton Contraction | Uniqueness | Fixed-point theorem | `interval_unique_root` |
| Norm-form Krawczyk | Existence + uniqueness for square differentiable systems | Interval Jacobian + Banach | certificate API |
| Bézout derivative | Global simplicity of all roots of a rational polynomial | Exact identity `A P + B P' = c ≠ 0` | certificate API |
| Discriminant count | Uniform 1-or-3 real-root count for cubic coefficient families | Interval sign of leading coefficient and discriminant, with adaptive subdivision | certificate API |
| Complete cubic isolation | Three unique roots and proof that no others exist | Positive discriminant + three ordered Newton contractions | certificate API |
| Cauchy/separation mesh | A-priori root radius and pairwise gap | Exact rational coefficient and discriminant inequalities | certificate API |

The Bézout layer is algebraic rather than isolating: it proves that roots are
simple globally. Its `QPoly.toExpr` bridge lets that fact compose with the
interval algorithms below. See
[Algebraic Root Certificates](../certificates/algebraic-roots.md).

The discriminant layer is global rather than isolating. Its coefficients may
be `Expr` families over a parameter box, and its subdivision checker resolves
interval dependency by proving the same strict sign on every child box.

For fixed rational cubics, the complete-isolation layer joins these worlds:
count globally, isolate locally, then use cardinality to prove exhaustion.
The companion Cauchy-radius and separation-mesh checker can choose a certified
search domain and a safe mesh width before local isolation starts.
Pure cubic representations and interval ordering remain under `Engine`; the
composition with the Newton Golden Theorem is intentionally located under
`Validity.Algebra`.

## Nonlinear Systems (Krawczyk)

For a square system `F : Fin n → Expr` in LeanCert's `ADSupported` fragment,
LeanCert can check an untrusted rational center `m` and rational preconditioner
`Y`. It computes an interval Jacobian on the box, bounds the infinity operator
norm of `I - Y J(X)`, and checks a strict self-map enclosure. A successful check
certifies exactly one real root in the box.

```lean
import LeanCert.Validity.Krawczyk

open LeanCert.Core LeanCert.Engine LeanCert.Validity

example (F : Fin n → Expr) (X : Fin n → IntervalRat)
    (cert : KrawczykCert n)
    (h : krawczykCheck F X cert = true) :
    ∃! x, FinBoxMem x X ∧ SystemZero F x := by
  exact verify_unique_system_root F X cert {} h
```

`KrawczykCert` is dimension-safe: malformed vector and matrix shapes cannot be
constructed. The checker accepts constants, variables, addition,
multiplication, negation, `sin`, `cos`, and `exp`. It uses a strong norm-form
condition, which is sometimes more conservative than the componentwise
textbook Krawczyk operator but gives a direct Banach proof.

Three golden theorems expose the same successful check in the common goal
shapes: `verify_system_root_exists`, `verify_system_root_unique`, and
`verify_unique_system_root`.

The automatic I2 front end exposes the last shape directly:

```lean
import LeanCert.Examples.Krawczyk
import LeanCert.Tactic

open LeanCert.Core LeanCert.Engine LeanCert.Validity
open LeanCert.Examples.Krawczyk

example : ∃! x, FinBoxMem x box ∧ SystemZero system x := by
  system_unique_root (trust := auto)
```

The generated center and preconditioner remain untrusted candidate data. The
search uses a box midpoint, singleton checked-AD Jacobian, pivoted rational
Gauss--Jordan inversion, and bounded interval-Newton refinement. It then runs
the same monolithic checker as `system_unique_root using certificate` and
reaches the theorem only through the configured verification route.

### Current limits

- Systems must be square and use the `ADSupported` expression fragment.
- Boxes, centers, and preconditioners use exact rational data.
- The norm-form enclosure is intentionally conservative; a rejected
  certificate is inconclusive.
- Automatic generation defaults to dimensions at most four; explicit
  certificates remain dimension-generic.
- Candidate refinement uses fixed dyadic precision to prevent denominator
  explosion in untrusted search data.
- Automatic search does not subdivide the target box. A certificate on one
  sub-box would not prove uniqueness over the original box.
- The theorem is over real boxes. Complex systems must first be represented as
  coupled real and imaginary coordinates.

## Bisection (Existence)

### How It Works

1. Evaluate f at interval endpoints
2. If signs differ, IVT guarantees a root exists
3. Recursively bisect to narrow the interval

```
f(a) < 0                    f(b) > 0
  ●━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━●
  a          root          b
             somewhere
             in here
```

### The Theorem

```lean
#check verify_sign_change
```
**Key insight**: The checker `checkSignChange` is computable, while the
conclusion is a semantic statement about real numbers. Its successful result
may be established through LeanCert's native, kernel, or automatic
verification route.

### Usage

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic.Discovery

open LeanCert.Core

def I12 : IntervalRat := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num⟩

-- Prove √2 exists (root of x² - 2)
example : ∃ x ∈ I12, Expr.eval (fun _ => x)
    (Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))) = 0 := by
  interval_roots
```

### Engine Algorithm

The advanced `Engine.RootFinding.Bisection` API recursively subdivides and can
return several candidate intervals. Its shape is:

```
bisectRoot(f, [a, b], depth):
  if depth = 0:
    return [a, b] if sign_change(f, a, b) else ∅

  mid = (a + b) / 2
  roots = []

  if sign_change(f, a, mid):
    roots += bisectRoot(f, [a, mid], depth - 1)

  if sign_change(f, mid, b):
    roots += bisectRoot(f, [mid, b], depth - 1)

  return roots
```

The `interval_roots` tactic is intentionally simpler: it checks for a sign
change on the interval stated in the goal and proves existence there. It does
not expose the engine's list of recursively isolated candidates.

### Limitations

- Only finds roots where sign changes (misses tangent roots like x² at 0)
- Requires continuity (cannot handle discontinuous functions)
- The advanced bisection engine may return multiple candidate intervals; the
  `interval_roots` tactic proves one existence statement on the supplied interval

## Newton Contraction (Uniqueness)

### How It Works

The Newton operator is:

\\[
N(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}
\\]

If we can show:
1. N maps interval I into itself: N(I) ⊆ I
2. N is a contraction: |N'(x)| < 1 for all x ∈ I

Then Banach fixed-point theorem guarantees exactly one root in I.

### The Theorem

The exact engine theorem is:

```lean
#check LeanCert.Engine.newton_contraction_unique_root
```

It accepts an `ADSupported` expression, a `UsesOnlyVar0` proof, the original
interval and a checked Newton image, evidence that either the Taylor-model or
simple Newton step produced that image, strict containment, and continuity.
The conclusion is uniqueness of a root in the original interval. Prefer
`interval_unique_root` unless you are building an engine-level certificate.

### Usage

```lean
def rootInterval : IntervalRat := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num⟩

def squareMinusTwo : Expr :=
  Expr.add (Expr.mul (Expr.var 0) (Expr.var 0)) (Expr.neg (Expr.const 2))

example : ∃! x, x ∈ rootInterval ∧
    Expr.eval (fun _ => x) squareMinusTwo = 0 := by
  unfold squareMinusTwo
  interval_unique_root
```

### Contraction Verification

To verify contraction, we bound |N'(x)|:

\\[
N'(x) = 1 - \frac{f'(x)^2 - f(x) \cdot f''(x)}{f'(x)^2} = \frac{f(x) \cdot f''(x)}{f'(x)^2}
\\]

Using interval arithmetic:
1. Compute interval bounds on f(I), f'(I), f''(I)
2. Check if |f(I) · f''(I)| / |f'(I)|² < 1

### Checker shape

The following is schematic pseudocode, not a Lean declaration:

```
checkNewtonContracts(f, I):
  # Compute function and derivatives on interval
  f_I   = evalInterval(f, I)
  f'_I  = evalInterval(derivative(f), I)
  f''_I = evalInterval(derivative(derivative(f)), I)

  # Check f' doesn't contain 0 (otherwise N undefined)
  if 0 ∈ f'_I:
    return false

  # Compute Newton image
  N_I = I - f_I / f'_I

  # Check maps into
  if not (N_I ⊆ I):
    return false

  # Check contraction (|N'| < 1)
  N'_bound = |f_I * f''_I| / (f'_I)²
  return N'_bound.hi < 1
```

### Refinement

The engine exposes `newtonStep`, which returns `Option IntervalRat`, and
iteration APIs such as `newtonIntervalGo`. A simplified loop has this shape:

```text
newtonRefine(e, I, n):
  match n with
  | 0       => I
  | n + 1   => if newtonStep(e, I) succeeds with J
               then newtonRefine(e, J, n)
               else I
```

Once sufficiently close to a simple root, classical Newton iteration is
quadratically convergent and often approximately doubles the number of correct
digits per successful step. That rate is not unconditional for every interval
Newton run.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Bisection | Newton |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Proves | Existence | Uniqueness |
| Requires | Sign change | f' ≠ 0, contraction |
| Convergence | Linear | Quadratic |
| Multiple roots | Advanced engine can return several sign-change candidates | Certifies at most one root in the checked interval |
| Tangent roots | Misses | Can verify if f' ≠ 0 nearby |

## Combined Workflow

For full root verification, first prove existence with `interval_roots`, then
prove uniqueness with `interval_unique_root`. Tighten the input interval and
rerun the existence proof when a narrower certified location is needed. The
complete compiled `squareMinusTwo` example above demonstrates both steps.
## Mean Value Theorem Bounds

For project-specific estimates, combine the certified derivative enclosure
with Mathlib's mean-value theorems. The exact hypotheses depend on whether the
development uses `HasDerivAt`, `DifferentiableOn`, or a convex-set formulation.
This is used internally for:
- Bounding how much f can change between sample points
- Verifying monotonicity
- Lipschitz constant estimation
