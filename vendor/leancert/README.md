**Certified numerics for Lean 4.**

LeanCert turns numerical certificates into theorems about real-valued
expressions. Its `leancert` tactic handles point inequalities, quantified
bounds on boxes and natural-number tails, root existence and uniqueness,
global bounds, finite sums, and definite integrals. Imported downstream
functions can participate through checked enclosure rules without being added
to LeanCert's internal expression language. The library also exposes the
checked interval, optimization, root-finding, and integration APIs underneath
the tactic.

## Five proofs

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

-- A transcendental constant inequality.
example : Real.log 2 < 7 / 10 := by
  leancert

-- One proof covers every real x in the interval.
example : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1,
    Real.exp x * Real.cos x ≤ 3 := by
  leancert

-- Existence and uniqueness, certified by interval and Newton arguments.
example : ∃! x, x ∈ Set.Icc (1 : ℝ) 2 ∧ x ^ 2 - 2 = 0 := by
  leancert

-- Polynomial integrals are normalized and checked exactly over ℚ.
example : (∫ x in (0 : ℝ)..1, x ^ 2) = 1 / 3 := by
  leancert

-- LeanCert discovers and certifies a cutoff for this infinite tail.
example : ∃ N : Nat, ∀ n ≥ N, (3 : ℝ) / n ^ 2 ≤ 1 / 1000 := by
  leancert
```

These are ordinary Lean theorems, not tests against sampled floating-point
values. The exact snippets above are compiled in CI.

## Install and prove something

LeanCert currently tracks the Lean and Mathlib versions in
[`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) and [`lakefile.toml`](lakefile.toml). Add it
to a Lake project:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "leancert"
git = "https://github.com/alerad/leancert"
rev = "main"
```

Then update dependencies:

```bash
lake update
```

Create `Main.lean`:

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : Real.exp 1 < 3 := by
  leancert
```

Check it with:

```bash
lake env lean Main.lean
```

For a reproducible development or release, pin `rev` to a commit or tag rather
than `main`.

## What is actually verified?

LeanCert separates finding a certificate, checking it, and interpreting it.

```text

                              │

                              ▼
                    executable certificate checker
                              │
                              │  proof that check = true
                              ▼
                  proved soundness / “golden” theorem
                              │
                              ▼
                       theorem in Lean
```

Search, heuristics, and candidate generation do not need to be trusted: a bad
candidate fails the checker. The checker is connected to the mathematical
claim by proved soundness theorems. CI audits the production golden theorems
for dependencies beyond Lean/Mathlib's standard foundations.

There are two ways to prove the closed proposition `check = true`:

| Mode | Certificate check | Trust added by the generated proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` (default) | `native_decide` | Lean kernel plus compiler/runtime |
| `kernel` | `decide +kernel` | Lean kernel only; never falls back |
| `auto` | kernel first, native when gated or unsuccessful | Reports native fallback |

Choose the route per proof:

```lean
import LeanCert.Tactic

example : Real.log 2 < 7 / 10 := by
  leancert (trust := kernel)
```

Or set it for a section or file with
`set_option leancert.trust "kernel"`. Numerical backend selection
(Rational/Dyadic/Affine) is independent of this verification choice.

See the authoritative [trust model](https://docs.leancert.io/architecture/trust-model/)
and the compiled [curated showcase](https://docs.leancert.io/showcase/).

## Why not `norm_num`, `positivity`, or a basic interval tactic?

These tools are complementary:

| Tool | Best at | What LeanCert adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `norm_num` | Exact normalization of concrete algebraic/numeric goals | Certified enclosures for transcendental expressions and quantified real domains |
| `positivity` | Deriving that an expression is nonnegative or positive | Quantitative upper/lower bounds, not just a sign |
| Basic interval tactics | Propagating enclosures through a supported expression | A semantic front door spanning bounds, subdivision/optimization, roots, sums, and integrals |

LeanCert itself uses ordinary algebraic automation for side conditions. Its
distinctive role is proof-producing numerical search plus a checked
certificate bridge to the final proposition. Run `leancert?` when you want to
see which dedicated solver the router selected.

## What is in the library?

The main verified numerical path includes:

- Rational, Dyadic, and Affine interval evaluation
- Algebraic operations and supported transcendental functions including
  `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `atan`, `atanh`, and `erf`
- Checked automatic differentiation and global bound certificates
- Root existence, exclusion, Newton-style uniqueness, and automatic or manual
  Krawczyk system-root certificates
- Exact rational polynomial integration and certified partition integration
- Checked downstream unary enclosure rules consumed compositionally by
  `leancert` or the lightweight `enclosure_bound` front door
- Fixed and automatically discovered reciprocal-power bounds over infinite
  natural-number tails
- Domain-specific Chebyshev, analytic-number-theory, q-product, table, and
  neural-network certificate infrastructure

For programmatic use, start with the stable `LeanCert` APIs:

- `LeanCert.evalInterval` and `LeanCert.evalInterval_correct`
- `LeanCert.API.Bounds`
- `LeanCert.API.Optimization`
- the checked AD, root, and integration APIs described in the
  [documentation](https://docs.leancert.io)

## Limitations

LeanCert provides sound automation for a supported fragment; it is not a
complete decision procedure for real analysis. A failed or inconclusive search
does not imply that the theorem is false.

- Tight bounds can require greater Taylor depth, subdivision, or a dedicated
  optimization tactic, and may still remain inconclusive.
- Sign-change certificates miss even-multiplicity roots, while Newton
  uniqueness requires additional certified hypotheses.
- Exact integral equalities are automated for rational polynomials; other
  supported integrands generally use certified partition bounds.
- Supported evaluators may require domain certificates, such as positivity for
  logarithms or exclusion of zero from denominator intervals.
- Downstream enclosure execution currently targets unary interval bounds.
  Existing core operations may surround proof-carrying registered subterms;
  rejected or inconclusive candidates are retried on rational bisections.
  Unsupported custom operations are not yet covered.
- Eventual-bound automation currently targets nonnegative rational multiples
  of reciprocal powers over `Nat`; general logarithmic, exponential, and
  AD-derived tail rules are not yet supported.

Native verification is faster but additionally trusts Lean's compiler/runtime;
kernel-only verification may be substantially more expensive. See the
[trust model](https://docs.leancert.io/architecture/trust-model/) and
[verification status](https://docs.leancert.io/architecture/verification-status/)
for precise trust boundaries, experimental subsystem qualifications, and the
Li₂ lightweight verification boundary.

The visible source layout follows the same ownership model: stable checked
entry points live in `LeanCert/API`, reusable numerical theorems in
`LeanCert/CertifiedBounds`, automation in `LeanCert/Tactic`, supported
demonstrations in `LeanCert/Examples`, and regressions in `LeanCert/Test`.
