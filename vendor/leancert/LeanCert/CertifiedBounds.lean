# LeanCert certified-bounds API

Stable umbrella for generated and pre-verified numerical bounds intended for
downstream use. New downstream developments should prefer

```lean
import LeanCert.CertifiedBounds
```

and declarations below `LeanCert.CertifiedBounds` over implementation modules
under `LeanCert.Engine`.

## Stability

Names in `LeanCert.CertifiedBounds` are part of LeanCert's supported downstream
API. Changes to their statements must be intentional and keep the downstream
pattern suite green.
