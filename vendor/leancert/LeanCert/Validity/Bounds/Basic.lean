# Bounds Module Index

This module re-exports all components of the bounds verification infrastructure.

## Submodules

- `Core`: Basic boolean checkers and golden theorems for bound verification
- `Checked`: Support for expressions with inverse-like operations (inv, log, atan, etc.)
- `Smart`: Monotonicity-aware bounds using derivative information
- `Bridge`: Set.Icc bridge theorems and subdivision combinators

## Usage

Import this module to get access to all bound verification functionality:

```lean
import LeanCert.Validity.Bounds.Basic
```
