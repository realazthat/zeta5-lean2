/-- error: LeanCert recognized: univariate interval bound

Attempts:
  1. registered compositional enclosure
     Registered enclosure subdivision reached its configured depth 0 after examining 1 boxes (deepest depth 0; 0 certified leaves). Last failure: The registered candidate was rejected by its checker.

Budget: spent 1 of 1

Next steps:
• Check whether the requested statement is true.
• Increase `(taylorDepth := ...)`, `(subdivisions := ...)`, or `(maxIterations := ...)` when the corresponding attempt was inconclusive.
• Use `interval_refute` to search for a certified counterexample. -/
