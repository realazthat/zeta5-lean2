# Trust-mode regression tests (`leancert.trust`)

Guards the verification choke point (`LeanCert.Tactic.closeCertificateGoalTyped`)
behind `interval_decide`:

* default (native) behavior is unchanged;
* `set_option leancert.trust "kernel"` closes certificates by kernel
  reduction only — the axiom pins below fail if `Lean.ofReduceBool` (or a
  `*.native_decide.ax_*` auxiliary) ever sneaks back in;
* `"auto"` stays foundational on goals the kernel can handle.

Earlier kernel-only tactic paths rotted because no test exercised strict kernel
verification. These pins are the guard against a repeat.
