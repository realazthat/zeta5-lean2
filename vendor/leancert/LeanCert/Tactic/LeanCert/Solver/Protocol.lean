# Semantic Solver Protocol

New semantic solvers return proof artifacts and typed expected outcomes.  They
do not mutate the user's original tactic goal.

Reporting invariants:

1. `strategy` is algorithmic, never arithmetic or trust.
2. Static backend policy and observed execution use different types.
3. `verificationRequested` and retained `verificationUsage` are distinct.
4. `checker` is executable evidence; `verifier` is its Golden Theorem.
5. Enclosures are retained values, never recomputed for display.
6. Reporting metadata never participates in proof validation. -/
