# Shared Bridge + Certificate-Verification Infrastructure

Common pattern for `finsum_bound`, `finsum_witness`, and `finmatrix_bound`:
apply a bridge proof term, close the Bool/ℚ check via the verification
boundary (`closeCertificateGoalTyped`, honoring `leancert.trust`), and handle
the case where the bridge's type isn't defEq to the goal via a
suffices + converter fallback.

/-- Apply a bridge proof and close its certificate through the configured
verification route.

If `proofTy` is definitionally equal to `goalType`, assigns directly.
Otherwise, uses a suffices + converter pattern:
1. Creates `suffMVar : proofTy` and `converterMVar : proofTy → goalType`
2. Assigns `goal := converterMVar suffMVar`
3. Closes `suffMVar` with the bridge proof
4. Closes `checkMVar` through the configured kernel/native/auto verification route
5. Tries each converter tactic in sequence on `converterMVar`

Parameters:
- `goal`: the main goal mvar
- `goalType`: the goal's type
- `proof`: the bridge proof term (with `checkMVar` as a placeholder argument)
- `checkMVar`: the mvar for the Bool/ℚ certificate check
- `tacticName`: name for error messages (e.g., "finsum_bound")
- `converterSteps`: fallback tactics to try (in order) for converting `proofTy → goalType`
