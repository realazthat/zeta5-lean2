# Verified Computation of li(2) - Heavy Numerical Verification

This file contains the heavy numerical verification of li(2) bounds using
interval arithmetic. It takes under a minute on a typical development machine due
to the `native_decide` calls that verify partition-based integration bounds using
the Dyadic backend.

## Purpose

This file proves `li2_bounds_verified`, which establishes:
  1.039 ≤ li(2) ≤ 1.06

The proof uses:
- Partition of [0, 1] into 7 subintervals
- Dyadic interval arithmetic with a checked, pilot-tuned 2300-cell partition on
  [1/1000, 999/1000]
- 100 partitions on tail intervals
- Analytic bounds on tiny tail intervals near 0 and 1

## Module Structure

The shared definitions and analytic lemmas are in `Li2Base.lean`. The public
interface is `LeanCert.CertifiedBounds.Li2`, which states the bounds with `sorry` so that
downstream projects (e.g. PNT+) do not pay this file's build cost — the
lightweight-interface/heavy-verification split agreed with PNT+ (PR #774).
This file imports the interface and ends with a statement-identity check
that fails compilation if the interface statements ever drift from the
verified theorems proven here.

## Verification Status

This file proves `li2_bounds_verified`, `li2_lower_verified`, and
`li2_upper_verified` with full verification.
