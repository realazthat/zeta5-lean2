# Certificate-Based Integration Test for li(2)

This file tests the certificate-based integration approach, which separates
the search phase (finding good partitions) from the verification phase
(checking that the bounds are valid).

## Key Insight

Standard approach: `native_decide` on 3000-partition uniform integration
- Kernel executes: evalInterval?1 3000 times, with branching/control flow

Certificate approach: Pre-compute partition bounds, verify linearly
- Certificate: List of (domain, bound) pairs
- Kernel executes: for each entry, verify bound is valid + sum is correct
- NO branching, NO recursion, just linear iteration

## Example Usage

The workflow is:
1. Run buildCertificate in untrusted code (Python, or `#eval` during development)
2. Save the certificate as a literal List of PartitionEntry
3. Use checkIntegralCertLowerBound/checkIntegralCertUpperBound for verification
4. The kernel only runs the linear checker, not the adaptive search

/-! ### Example: Manually constructed certificate

This demonstrates the certificate structure. In practice, you would:
1. Run `buildCertificate` during development
2. Copy the partition entries to a literal list
3. Use the literal list for verification

For now, we construct a single-partition certificate inline.
The key point is that verification is LINEAR - no search logic.

/-- Manually constructed partition entry.
    Domain: [1/5, 4/5]
    Bound: Computed from evalInterval?1 g_alt_expr [1/5, 4/5]

    In practice, these would be pre-computed and stored as literals. -/
def manual_entry : PartitionEntry :=
  match evalInterval?1 g_alt_expr small_interval with
  | some computed =>
    let width := small_interval.hi - small_interval.lo
    let blo := min (computed.lo * width) (computed.hi * width)
    let bhi := max (computed.lo * width) (computed.hi * width)
    { domain := small_interval
      bound := ⟨blo, bhi, le_max_of_le_left (min_le_left _ _)⟩ }
  | none => default  -- Fallback (should not happen)

/-- Manual certificate with single partition -/
def manual_cert : IntegralCertificate :=
  { expr_id := "g_alt_test"
    domain := small_interval
    partitions := [manual_entry]
  }

-- Debug: Check each component of verification individually
-- First, let's verify the partition entry is created correctly
#eval do
  let entry := manual_entry
  IO.println s!"Entry domain: [{entry.domain.lo}, {entry.domain.hi}]"
  IO.println s!"Entry bound: [{entry.bound.lo}, {entry.bound.hi}]"

-- The single partition check should work
-- example : checkPartitionBound g_alt_expr manual_entry = true := by native_decide
#eval checkPartitionBound g_alt_expr manual_entry

-- Coverage check passes (single partition covers the domain)
-- example : checkCoverage manual_cert.partitions manual_cert.domain = true := by native_decide
#eval checkCoverage manual_cert.partitions manual_cert.domain

-- All bounds check passes
-- example : checkAllBounds g_alt_expr manual_cert.partitions = true := by native_decide
#eval checkAllBounds g_alt_expr manual_cert.partitions

-- Check sum computation
#eval do
  let sum := sumBounds manual_cert.partitions
  IO.println s!"Sum of bounds: [{sum.lo}, {sum.hi}]"

-- Check target containment (need large target for single-partition case)
#eval checkSumInTarget manual_cert.partitions ⟨-100, 100, by norm_num⟩

-- Full verification with large target
#eval verifyCertificate g_alt_expr manual_cert ⟨-100, 100, by norm_num⟩

-- Verified example with native_decide
example : verifyCertificate g_alt_expr manual_cert
    ⟨-100, 100, by norm_num⟩ = true := by native_decide

/-! ### Comparison: Certificate vs Uniform

Both approaches verify the same thing, but certificate checking is LINEAR
while uniform partitioning involves the search/subdivision logic.

-- Quick smoke test: uniform integration works on small interval

  native_decide
