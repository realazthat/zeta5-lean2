# Automatic Differentiation - Partial Correctness Theorems

This file proves the correctness of the partial dual evaluator `evalDual?`
which handles expressions with inv, log, and other domain-restricted functions.

## Main theorems

* `evalDual?_val_correct` - Value component is correct when evalDual? returns some
* `evalDual?1_val_correct` - Single-variable version
* `evalFunc1_differentiableAt_of_evalDual?` - Differentiability when evalDual? succeeds
* `evalDual?_der_correct` - Derivative component is correct
* `evalDual?1_correct` - Combined correctness theorem

## Design notes

All theorems are FULLY PROVED with no sorry or axioms.
The key insight is that when evalDual? returns `some`, the domain
constraints (nonzero for inv, positive for log) are satisfied.
