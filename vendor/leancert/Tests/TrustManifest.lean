# Trust manifest for exported declarations

`#assert_trust` pins for the representative public surface. This complements
`Tests/AxiomAudit.lean`:

* AxiomAudit pins *exact axiom sets* for golden theorems and sweeps the whole
  library for illegally minted axioms;
* this manifest classifies exported results by *trust class* and fails on
  drift in **either** direction — a kernel-clean theorem acquiring compiler
  trust is a regression, and a native-pinned theorem losing its native
  dependency means the pin should be tightened to `kernel`.

CI runs this file in the soundness-guard workflow (after AxiomAudit).
When exporting a new headline result, add its pin here.

/-! ## Golden theorems: kernel-clean by construction

The lifts from Boolean certificates to semantic propositions must never
depend on compiler trust — every proof produced by any trust mode reuses
them unchanged. -/

/-! ## Euler–Mascheroni bounds: intentionally native-trusted

Verified by an inline `native_decide` over a `2^20`-term reflective harmonic
sum — the scale at which native evaluation earns its trust cost (see the
calibration in `scripts/bench-trust/README.md`). If these ever stop
depending on native trust, the pins below fail and should be tightened to
`kernel` (and celebrated). -/
